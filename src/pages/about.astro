    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Florian Ohrel and I'm a developer based in Paris / Lille,
      France.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2021, after having dabbled in various fields, I made the decision to
      attend <a href="https://42.fr/en/homepage/"><u>42 school</u></a>. Thus, I
      found myself falling headfirst into the rabbit hole of coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from that, I play video games ðŸŽ®, listen to a lot of music ðŸŽµ, get
      around by cycling ðŸš´, and climb in my spare time ðŸ§—.
